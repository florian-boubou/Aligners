# Aligners

I'm making this little project in order to become more familiar with pattern designs, inheritance, interface etc.

The goal is to make a cool classes structure, these classes all implement the TextAligner interface that aims to align text, a simple interface. I tried to make this the most clean possible. I'll try to document it the right way too.
